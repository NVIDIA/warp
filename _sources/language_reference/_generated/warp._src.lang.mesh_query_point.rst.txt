      * Kernel
      * Differentiable

   Compute the closest point on the :class:`warp.Mesh` with identifier ``id`` to the given ``point`` in space.
   
   Identifies the sign of the distance using additional ray-casts to determine if the point is inside or outside.
   This method is relatively robust, but does increase computational cost.
   See below for additional sign determination methods.
   
   :param id: The mesh identifier
   :param point: The point in space to query
   :param max_dist: Mesh faces above this distance will not be considered by the query.
