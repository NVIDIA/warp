   Move to the next bound returned by the query.
   
   The index of the current bound is stored in ``index``, returns ``False`` if there are no more overlapping bounds.
   The maximum distance along a ray query to check for intersections can be set using ``max_dist``. It is not effective
   for aabb query.
   
   Note that increasing ``max_dist`` may result in missing intersections. Since previously rejected subtrees will never be
   revisited even if it intersects with the new, longer ray. In other words, it's only safe to monotonically
   reduce ``max_dist`` during a query.
   
   :param query: The query to move to the next bound
   :param index: The index of the current bound
   :param max_dist: The maximum distance along the ray to check for intersections for ray queries. Not effective for aabb query.
