warp.\_src.lang.tile\_bvh\_query\_aabb
======================================

.. function:: warp._src.lang.tile_bvh_query_aabb(id: uint64, low: vec3f, high: vec3f) -> BvhQueryTiled

   .. hlist::
      :columns: 8

      * Kernel

   Construct an axis-aligned bounding box query against a BVH object for thread-block parallel traversal.
   
   This query can be used in tiled kernels to cooperatively traverse a BVH across a thread block.
   
   .. note:: This is an alias for :func:`bvh_query_aabb_tiled`.
   
   :param id: The BVH identifier
   :param low: The lower bound of the bounding box in BVH space (must be the same for all threads in the block)
   :param high: The upper bound of the bounding box in BVH space (must be the same for all threads in the block)
