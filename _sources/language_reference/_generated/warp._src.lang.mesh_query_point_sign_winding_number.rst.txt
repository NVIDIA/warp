   Compute the closest point on the :class:`warp.Mesh` with identifier ``id`` to the given point in space.
   
   Identifies the sign using the winding number of the mesh relative to the query point. This method of sign determination is robust for poorly conditioned meshes
   and provides a smooth approximation to sign even when the mesh is not watertight. This method is the most robust and accurate of the sign determination meshes
   but also the most expensive.
   
   .. note:: The :class:`warp.Mesh` object must be constructed with ``support_winding_number=True`` for this method to return correct results.
   
   :param id: The mesh identifier
   :param point: The point in space to query
   :param max_dist: Mesh faces above this distance will not be considered by the query
   :param accuracy: Accuracy for computing the winding number with fast winding number method utilizing second-order dipole approximation, default 2.0
   :param threshold: The threshold of the winding number to be considered inside, default 0.5.
