warp.\_src.lang.static
======================

.. function:: warp._src.lang.static(expr: Any) -> Any

   .. hlist::
      :columns: 8

      * Kernel

   Evaluate a static Python expression and replaces it with its result.
   
   See the :ref:`code generation guide <static_expressions>` for more details.
   
   The inner expression must only reference variables that are available from the current scope where the Warp kernel or function containing the expression is defined,
   which includes constant variables and variables captured in the current closure in which the function or kernel is implemented.
   The return type of the expression must be either a Warp function, a string, or a type that is supported inside Warp kernels and functions
   (excluding Warp arrays since they cannot be created in a Warp kernel at the moment).
