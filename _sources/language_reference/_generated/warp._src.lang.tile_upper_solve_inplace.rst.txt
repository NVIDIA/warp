===========================================

.. function:: warp._src.lang.tile_upper_solve_inplace(U: Tile[Float,tuple[int, int]], z: Tile[Float,tuple[int]]) -> None

   .. hlist::
      :columns: 8

      * Kernel

   Solve for ``x`` in ``Ux = z``, where ``U`` is an upper triangular matrix by overwriting ``z`` with ``x``.
   
   This performs general back substitution for upper triangular systems inplace.
   
   Note: This inplace variant does not support automatic differentiation (adjoint computation),
   but avoids allocating shared memory for the output ``x`` by reusing ``z``'s memory.
   
   Supported datatypes are:
       * float32
       * float64
   
   :param U: A square, non-singular, upper triangular matrix
   :param z: A 1D or 2D tile with compatible shape that gets overwritten by ``x`` where ``Ux = z``.
