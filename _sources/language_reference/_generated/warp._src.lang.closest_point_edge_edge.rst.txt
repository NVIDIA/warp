      * Kernel
      * Differentiable

   Find the closest points between two edges.
   
   :param p1: First point of first edge
   :param q1: Second point of first edge
   :param p2: First point of second edge
   :param q2: Second point of second edge
   :param epsilon: Zero tolerance for determining if points in an edge are degenerate.
   :param out: vec3 output containing (s,t,d), where ``s`` in [0,1] is the barycentric weight for the first edge, ``t`` is the barycentric weight for the second edge, and ``d`` is the distance between the two edges at these two closest points.
   
   :returns: Barycentric weights to the points on each edge, as well as the closest distance between the edges.
