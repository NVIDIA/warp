warp.\_src.lang.tid
===================

.. function:: warp._src.lang.tid() -> int

   .. hlist::
      :columns: 8

      * Kernel

   Query the current thread index or indices.
   
   The return type is determined by the unpacking syntax used:
   
   - ``i = wp.tid()`` - Returns the first thread index as ``int``
   - ``i, j = wp.tid()`` - Returns the first two indices as ``tuple[int, int]``
   - ``i, j, k = wp.tid()`` - Returns the first three indices as ``tuple[int, int, int]``
   - ``i, j, k, l = wp.tid()`` - Returns all four indices as ``tuple[int, int, int, int]``
   
   The indices correspond to the thread's position in the kernel launch grid.
   If fewer indices are requested than the launch dimensionality, only the
   leading indices are returned.
   
   This function may not be called from user-defined Warp functions.
