   Compute the closest point on the :class:`warp.Mesh` with identifier ``id`` to the given ``point`` in space.
   
   Identifies the sign of the distance (inside/outside) using the angle-weighted pseudo normal.
   This approach to sign determination is robust for well conditioned meshes that are watertight and non-self intersecting.
   It is also comparatively fast to compute.
   
   :param id: The mesh identifier
   :param point: The point in space to query
   :param max_dist: Mesh faces above this distance will not be considered by the query
   :param epsilon: Epsilon treating distance values as equal, when locating the minimum distance vertex/face/edge, as a
                   fraction of the average edge length, also for treating closest point as being on edge/vertex default 1e-3.
