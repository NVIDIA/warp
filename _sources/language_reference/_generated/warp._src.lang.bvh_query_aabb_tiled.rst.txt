      * Kernel

   Construct an axis-aligned bounding box query against a BVH object for thread-block parallel traversal.
   
   This query can be used in tiled kernels to cooperatively traverse a BVH across a thread block.
   
   :param id: The BVH identifier
   :param low: The lower bound of the bounding box in BVH space (must be the same for all threads in the block)
   :param high: The upper bound of the bounding box in BVH space (must be the same for all threads in the block)
