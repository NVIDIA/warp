   Compute the closest point on the :class:`warp.Mesh` with identifier ``id`` to the given ``point`` in space.
   
   The method will cast multiple rays starting from the query point by applying
   small random perturbations to a base direction (1, 1, 1). Each perturbation is
   sampled independently for the x, y, and z dimensions from a uniform distribution
   in the range [-perturbation_scale, perturbation_scale), and added to the base
   direction to produce a slightly altered ray direction. This randomization helps
   avoid degeneracies such as rays intersecting exactly on triangle edges,
   vertices, or becoming parallel to mesh features.
   
   For each perturbed ray, the method counts how many mesh faces it intersects and
   uses the parity (odd/even) of this count to determine whether the ray exits the
   mesh (odd -> inside, even -> outside). A majority vote over all sampled rays is
   used to classify the point.
   
   :param id: The mesh identifier
   :param point: The point in space to query
   :param max_dist: Mesh faces above this distance will not be considered by the query
   :param n_sample: Number of rays to cast (default: 1). Use a higher value if the sign is inaccurate.
   :param perturbation_scale: Scale of the perturbation.
