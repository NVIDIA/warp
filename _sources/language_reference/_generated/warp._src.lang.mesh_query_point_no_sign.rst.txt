============================================

      * Kernel
      * Differentiable

   Compute the closest point on the :class:`warp.Mesh` with identifier ``id`` to the given ``point`` in space.
   
   This method does not compute the sign of the point (inside/outside) which makes it faster than other point query methods.
   
   :param id: The mesh identifier
   :param point: The point in space to query
   :param max_dist: Mesh faces above this distance will not be considered by the query.
