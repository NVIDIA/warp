      * Kernel

   Move to the next bound in a thread-block parallel BVH query and return results as a tile.
   
   Each thread in the block receives one result index in the returned tile, or -1 if no result for that thread.
   The function returns a register tile of shape ``(block_dim,)`` containing the result indices.
   
   To check if any results were found, check if any element in the tile is >= 0.
   
   .. note:: This is an alias for :func:`bvh_query_next_tiled`.
   
   :param query: The thread-block BVH query object
   
   :returns:
   
             A register tile of shape ``(block_dim,)`` with dtype int, where each element contains
                 the result index for that thread (-1 if no result)
