warp.\_src.lang.tile\_cholesky\_inplace
=======================================

.. function:: warp._src.lang.tile_cholesky_inplace(A: Tile[Float,tuple[int, int]]) -> None

   .. hlist::
      :columns: 8

      * Kernel

   Compute the Cholesky factorization ``L`` of a matrix ``A``.
   
   ``L`` is lower triangular and satisfies ``LL^T = A``.
   
   Only the lower triangular portion of ``A`` is used for the decomposition;
   the upper triangular part may be left unspecified.
   
   Note: This inplace variant does not support automatic differentiation (adjoint computation),
   but offers improved performance and uses half the shared memory compared to the standard version.
   
   Supported datatypes are:
       * float32
       * float64
   
   :param A: A square, symmetric positive-definite, matrix. Only the lower triangular part of ``A`` is replaced by ``L``, such that ``LL^T = A``; the upper part is untouched.
