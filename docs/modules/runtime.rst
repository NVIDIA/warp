Kernels
-------

Kernels are launched with the ``warp.launch()`` function on a specific device (CPU/GPU)::

   wp.launch(simple_kernel, dim=1024, inputs=[a, b, c], device="cuda")

Kernels may be launched with multi-dimensional grid bounds. In this case threads are not assigned a single index, but a coordinate in of an n-dimensional grid, e.g.::

   wp.launch(complex_kernel, dim=(128, 128, 3), ...)

Launches a 3d grid of threads with dimension 128x128x3. To retrieve the 3d index for each thread use the following syntax::

   i,j,k = wp.tid()

.. note::
   Currently kernels launched on ``cpu`` devices will be executed in serial. Kernels launched on ``cuda`` devices will be launched in parallel with a fixed block-size.

.. note::
   Note that all the kernel inputs must live on the target device, or a runtime exception will be raised.

.. autofunction:: launch

Arrays
------

Arrays are the fundamental memory abstraction in Warp; they are created through the following global constructors: ::

    wp.empty(shape=1024, dtype=wp.vec3, device="cpu")
    wp.zeros(shape=1024, dtype=float, device="cuda")


Arrays can also be constructed directly from ``numpy`` ndarrays as follows: ::

   r = np.random.rand(1024)

   # copy to Warp owned array
   a = wp.array(r, dtype=float, device="cpu")

   # return a Warp array wrapper around the NumPy data (zero-copy)
   a = wp.array(r, dtype=float, copy=False, device="cpu")

   # return a Warp copy of the array data on the GPU
   a = wp.array(r, dtype=float, device="cuda")

Note that for multi-dimensional data the ``dtype`` parameter must be specified explicitly, e.g.: ::

   r = np.random.rand((1024, 3))

   # initialize as an array of vec3 objects
   a = wp.array(r, dtype=wp.vec3, device="cuda")

If the shapes are incompatible an error will be raised.


Arrays can be moved between devices using the ``array.to()`` method: ::

   host_array = wp.array(a, dtype=float, device="cpu")

   # allocate and copy to GPU
   device_array = host_array.to("cuda")

Additionally, arrays can be copied directly between memory spaces: ::

   src_array = wp.array(a, dtype=float, device="cpu")
   dest_array = wp.empty_like(host_array)

   # copy from source CPU buffer to GPU
   wp.copy(dest_array, src_array)

Multi-dimensional arrays
########################

Multi-dimensional arrays can be constructed by passing a tuple of sizes for each dimension, e.g.: the following constructs a 2d array of size 1024x16::

    wp.zeros(shape=(1024, 16), dtype=float, device="cuda")

When passing multi-dimensional arrays to kernels users must specify the expected array dimension inside the kernel signature,
e.g. to pass a 2d array to a kernel the number of dims is specified using the ``ndim=2`` parameter::

   @wp.kernel
   def test(input: wp.array(dtype=float, ndim=2)):

Type-hint helpers are provided for common array sizes, e.g.: ``array2d()``, ``array3d()``, which are equivalent to calling ``array(..., ndim=2)```, etc. To index a multi-dimensional array use a the following kernel syntax::

   # returns a float from the 2d array
   value = input[i,j]

To create an array slice use the following syntax, where the number of indices is less than the array dimensions::

   # returns an 1d array slice representing a row of the 2d array
   row = input[i]

Slice operators can be concatenated, e.g.: ``s = array[i][j][k]``. Slices can be passed to ``wp.func`` user functions provided
the function also declares the expected array dimension. Currently only single-index slicing is supported.

.. note::
   Currently Warp limits arrays to 4 dimensions maximum. This is in addition to the contained datatype, which may be 1-2 dimensional for vector and matrix types such as ``vec3``, and ``mat33``.


The following construction methods are provided for allocating zero-initialized and empty (non-initialized) arrays:

.. autofunction:: zeros
.. autofunction:: zeros_like
.. autofunction:: empty
.. autofunction:: empty_like
.. autofunction:: copy
.. autofunction:: clone

.. autoclass:: array

Matrix Multiplication
#####################

Warp 2D array multiplication is built on NVIDIA's CUTLASS library, which enables fast matrix multiplication of large arrays on the GPU.

If no GPU is detected, matrix multiplication falls back to Numpy's implementation on the CPU.

Matrix multiplication is fully differentiable, and can be recorded on the tape like so::

   tape = wp.Tape()
   with tape:
      wp.matmul(A, B, C, D, device=device)
      wp.launch(loss_kernel, dim=(m, n), inputs=[D, loss], device=device)

   tape.backward(loss=loss)
   A_grad = A.grad.numpy()

Using the ``@`` operator (``D = A @ B``) will default to the same CUTLASS algorithm used in ``wp.matmul``.

.. autofunction:: matmul

Data Types
----------

Scalar Types
############

The following scalar storage types are supported for array structures:

+---------+------------------------+
| int8    | signed byte            |
+---------+------------------------+
| uint8   | unsigned byte          |
+---------+------------------------+
| int16   | signed short           |
+---------+------------------------+
| uint16  | unsigned short         |
+---------+------------------------+
| int32   | signed integer         |
+---------+------------------------+
| uint32  | unsigned integer       |
+---------+------------------------+
| int64   | signed long integer    |
+---------+------------------------+
| uint64  | unsigned long integer  |
+---------+------------------------+
| float32 | single precision float |
+---------+------------------------+
| float64 | double precision float |
+---------+------------------------+

Warp supports ``float`` and ``int`` as aliases for ``wp.float32`` and ``wp.int32`` respectively.


Vectors
#######

Warp provides built-in math and geometry types for common simulation and graphics problems. A full reference for operators and functions for these types is available in the :any:`functions`.

Warp supports vectors of numbers with an arbitrary length/numeric type. The built in concrete types are as follows:

+-----------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| vec2 vec3 vec4        | 2d, 3d, 4d vector of default precision floats  |
+-----------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| vec2f vec3f vec4f     | 2d, 3d, 4d vector of single precision floats   |
+-----------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| vec2d vec3d vec4d     | 2d, 3d, 4d vector of double precision floats   |
+-----------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| vec2h vec3h vec4h     | 2d, 3d, 4d vector of half precision floats     |
+-----------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| vec2ub vec3ub vec4ub  | 2d, 3d, 4d vector of half precision floats     |
+-----------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| spatial_vector        | 6d vector of single precision floats           |
+-----------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| spatial_vectorf       | 6d vector of single precision floats           |
+-----------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| spatial_vectord       | 6d vector of double precision floats           |
+-----------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| spatial_vectorh       | 6d vector of half precision floats             |
+-----------------------+------------------------------------------------+

Vectors support most standard linear algebra operations, e.g.: ::

   @wp.kernel
   def compute( ... ):

      # basis vectors
      a = wp.vec3(1.0, 0.0, 0.0)
      b = wp.vec3(0.0, 1.0, 0.0)

      # take the cross product
      c = wp.cross(a, b)

      # compute
      r = wp.dot(c, c)

      ...


It's possible to declare additional vector types with different lengths and data types. This is done in outside of kernels in *Python scope* using ``warp.types.vector()``, for example: ::

   # declare a new vector type for holding 5 double precision floats:
   vec5d = wp.types.vector(length=5, dtype=wp.float64)

Once declared, the new type can be used when allocating arrays or inside kernels: ::

   # create an array of vec5d
   arr = wp.zeros(10, dtype=vec5d)

   # use inside a kernel
   @wp.kernel
   def compute( ... ):

      # zero initialize a custom named vector type
      v = vec5d()
      ...

      # component-wise initialize a named vector type
      v = vec5d(wp.float64(1.0),
                wp.float64(2.0),
                wp.float64(3.0),
                wp.float64(4.0),
                wp.float64(5.0))
      ...

In addition, it's possible to directly create *anonymously* typed instances of these vectors without declaring their type in advance. In this case the type will be inferred by the constructor arguments. For example: ::

   @wp.kernel
   def compute( ... ):

      # zero initialize vector of 5 doubles:
      v = wp.vector(dtype=wp.float64, length=5)

      # scalar initialize a vector of 5 doubles to the same value:
      v = wp.vector(wp.float64(1.0), length=5)

      # component-wise initialize a vector of 5 doubles
      v = wp.vector(wp.float64(1.0),
                    wp.float64(2.0),
                    wp.float64(3.0),
                    wp.float64(4.0),
                    wp.float64(5.0))


These can be used with all the standard vector arithmetic operators, e.g.: ``+``, ``-``, scalar multiplication, and can also be transformed using matrices with compatible dimensions, potentially returning vectors with a different length.

Matrices
########

Matrices with arbitrary shapes/numeric types are also supported. The built in concrete matrix types are as follows:

+--------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| mat22 mat33 mat44        | 2,3 and 4d square matrix of default precision       |
+--------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| mat22f mat33f mat44f     | 2,3 and 4d square matrix of single precision floats |
+--------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| mat22d mat33d mat44d     | 2,3 and 4d square matrix of double precision floats |
+--------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| mat22h mat33h mat44h     | 2,3 and 4d square matrix of half precision floats   |
+--------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| spatial_matrix           | 6x6 matrix of single precision floats               |
+--------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| spatial_matrixf          | 6x6 matrix of single precision floats               |
+--------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| spatial_matrixd          | 6x6 matrix of double precision floats               |
+--------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| spatial_matrixh          | 6x6 matrix of half precision floats                 |
+--------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+

Matrices are stored in row-major format and support most standard linear algebra operations: ::

   @wp.kernel
   def compute( ... ):

      # initialize matrix
      m = wp.mat22(1.0, 2.0,
                   3.0, 4.0)

      # compute inverse
      minv = wp.inverse(m)

      # transform vector
      v = minv * wp.vec2(0.5, 0.3)

      ...


In a similar manner to vectors, it's possible to declare new matrix types with arbitrary shapes and data types using ``wp.types.matrix()``, for example: ::

   # declare a new 3x2 half precision float matrix type:
   mat32h = wp.types.matrix(shape=(3,2), dtype=wp.float64)

   # create an array of this type
   a = wp.zeros(10, dtype=mat32h)

These can be used inside a kernel: ::

   @wp.kernel
   def compute( ... ):
      ...

      # initialize a mat32h matrix
      m = mat32h(wp.float16(1.0), wp.float16(2.0),
                 wp.float16(3.0), wp.float16(4.0),
                 wp.float16(5.0), wp.float16(6.0))

      # declare a 2 component half precision vector
      v2 = wp.vec2h(wp.float16(1.0), wp.float16(1.0))

      # multiply by the matrix, returning a 3 component vector:
      v3 = m * v2
      ...

It's also possible to directly create anonymously typed instances inside kernels where the type is inferred from constructor arguments as follows: ::

   @wp.kernel
   def compute( ... ):
      ...

      # create a 3x2 half precision matrix from components (row major ordering):
      m = wp.matrix(
            wp.float16(1.0), wp.float16(2.0),
            wp.float16(1.0), wp.float16(2.0),
            wp.float16(1.0), wp.float16(2.0),
            shape=(3,2))

      # zero initialize a 3x2 half precision matrix:
      m = wp.matrix(wp.float16(0.0),shape=(3,2))

      # create a 5x5 double precision identity matrix:
      m = wp.identity(n=5, dtype=wp.float64)

As with vectors, you can do standard matrix arithmetic with these variables, along with multiplying matrices with compatible shapes and potentially returning a matrix with a new shape.

Quaternions
###########

Warp supports quaternions with the layout ``i, j, k, w`` where ``w`` is the real part. Here are the built in concrete quaternion types:

+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| quat            | Default precision floating point quaternion   |
+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| quatf           | Single precision floating point quaternion    |
+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| quatd           | Double precision floating point quaternion    |
+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| quath           | Half precision floating point quaternion      |
+-----------------+-----------------------------------------------+

Quaternions can be used to transform vectors as follows: ::

   @wp.kernel
   def compute( ... ):
      ...

      # construct a 30 degree rotation around the x-axis
      q = wp.quat_from_axis_angle(wp.vec3(1.0, 0.0, 0.0), wp.degrees(30.0))

      # rotate an axis by this quaternion
      v = wp.quat_rotate(q, wp.vec3(0.0, 1.0, 0.0))


As with vectors and matrices, you can declare quaternion types with an arbitrary numeric type like so: ::

   quatd = wp.types.quaternion(dtype=wp.float64)

You can also create identity quaternion and anonymously typed instances inside a kernel like so: ::

   @wp.kernel
   def compute( ... ):
      ...

      # create a double precision identity quaternion:
      qd = wp.quat_identity(dtype=wp.float64)

      # precision defaults to wp.float32 so this creates a single precision identity quaternion:
      qf = wp.quat_identity()

      # create a half precision quaternion from components, or a vector/scalar:
      qh = wp.quaternion(wp.float16(0.0),
                         wp.float16(0.0),
                         wp.float16(0.0),
                         wp.float16(1.0))


      qh = wp.quaternion(
         wp.vector(wp.float16(0.0),wp.float16(0.0),wp.float16(0.0)),
         wp.float16(1.0))

Transforms
##########

Transforms are 7d vectors of floats representing a spatial rigid body transformation in format (p, q) where p is a 3d vector, and q is a quaternion.

+-----------------+--------------------------------------------+
| transform       | Default precision floating point transform |
+-----------------+--------------------------------------------+
| transformf      | Single precision floating point transform  |
+-----------------+--------------------------------------------+
| transformd      | Double precision floating point transform  |
+-----------------+--------------------------------------------+
| transformh      | Half precision floating point transform    |
+-----------------+--------------------------------------------+

Transforms can be constructed inside kernels from translation and rotation parts: ::

   @wp.kernel
   def compute( ... ):
      ...

      # create a transform from a vector/quaternion:
      t = wp.transform(
             wp.vec3(1.0, 2.0, 3.0),
             wp.quat_from_axis_angle(0.0, 1.0, 0.0, wp.degrees(30.0)))

      # transform a point
      p = wp.transform_point(t, wp.vec3(10.0, 0.5, 1.0))

      # transform a vector (ignore translation)
      p = wp.transform_vector(t, wp.vec3(10.0, 0.5, 1.0))


As with vectors and matrices, you can declare transform types with an arbitrary numeric type using ``warp.types.transformation()``, for example: ::

   transformd = wp.types.transformation(dtype=wp.float64)

You can also create identity transforms and anonymously typed instances inside a kernel like so: ::

   @wp.kernel
   def compute( ... ):

      # create double precision identity transform:
      qd = wp.transform_identity(dtype=wp.float64)

Structs
#######

Users can define custom structure types using the ``@wp.struct`` decorator as follows::

   @wp.struct
   class MyStruct:

      param1: int
      param2: float
      param3: wp.array(dtype=wp.vec3)

Struct attributes must be annotated with their respective type. They can be constructed in Python scope and then passed to kernels as arguments::

   @wp.kernel
   def compute(args: MyStruct):

      tid = wp.tid()

      print(args.param1)
      print(args.param2)
      print(args.param3[tid])

   # construct an instance of the struct in Python
   s = MyStruct()
   s.param1 = 10
   s.param2 = 2.5
   s.param3 = wp.zeros(shape=10, dtype=wp.vec3)

   # pass to our compute kernel
   wp.launch(compute, dim=10, inputs=[s])

Arrays of structs can zero initialized as follows::

      a = wp.zeros(shape=10, dtype=MyStruct)

Or initialized from a list of struct objects::

      a = wp.array([MyStruct(), MyStruct(), MyStruct()], dtype=MyStruct)


Type Conversions
################

Warp is particularly strict regarding type conversions and does not perform *any* implicit conversion between numeric types. The user is responsible for ensuring types for most arithmetic operators match, e.g.: ``x = float(0.0) + int(4)`` will result in an error. This can be surprising for users that are accustomed to C-style conversions but avoids a class of common bugs that result from implicit conversions.

.. note:: Warp does not currently perform implicit type conversions between numeric types. Users should explicitly cast variables to compatible types using constructors like ``int()``, ``float()``, ``wp.float16()``, ``wp.uint8()`` etc.

Constants
---------

In general, Warp kernels cannot access variables in the global Python interpreter state. One exception to this is for compile-time constants, which may be declared globally (or as class attributes) and folded into the kernel definition.

Constants are defined using the ``warp.constant()`` function. An example is shown below::

   TYPE_SPHERE = wp.constant(0)
   TYPE_CUBE = wp.constant(1)
   TYPE_CAPSULE = wp.constant(2)

   @wp.kernel
   def collide(geometry: wp.array(dtype=int)):

      t = geometry[wp.tid()]

      if (t == TYPE_SPHERE):
         print("sphere")
      if (t == TYPE_CUBE):
         print("cube")
      if (t == TYPE_CAPSULE):
         print("capsule")

Operators
----------

Boolean Operators
#################

+--------------+--------------------------------------+
|   a and b    | True if a and b are True             |
+--------------+--------------------------------------+
|   a or b     | True if a or b is True               |
+--------------+--------------------------------------+
|   not a      | True if a is False, otherwise False  |
+--------------+--------------------------------------+

.. note::

   Expressions such as ``if (a and b):`` currently do not perform short-circuit evaluation. In this case ``b`` will also be evaluated even when ``a`` is ``False``. Users should take care to ensure that secondary conditions are safe to evaluate (e.g.: do not index out of bounds) in all cases.


Comparison Operators
####################

+----------+---------------------------------------+
| a > b    | True if a strictly greater than b     |
+----------+---------------------------------------+
| a < b    | True if a strictly less than b        |
+----------+---------------------------------------+
| a >= b   | True if a greater than or equal to b  |
+----------+---------------------------------------+
| a <= b   | True if a less than or equal to b     |
+----------+---------------------------------------+
| a == b   | True if a equals b                    |
+----------+---------------------------------------+
| a != b   | True if a not equal to b              |
+----------+---------------------------------------+

Arithmetic Operators
####################

+-----------+--------------------------+
|  a + b    | Addition                 |
+-----------+--------------------------+
|  a - b    | Subtraction              |
+-----------+--------------------------+
|  a * b    | Multiplication           |

|  a / b    | Floating point division  |
+-----------+--------------------------+
|  a // b   | Floored division         |

+-----------+--------------------------+
|  a % b    | Modulus                  |
+-----------+--------------------------+

.. note::
   Since implicit conversions are not performed arguments types to operators should match. Users should use type constructors, e.g.: ``float()``, ``int()``, ``wp.int64(), etc`` to cast variables to the correct type. Also note that the multiplication expression ``a * b`` is used to represent scalar multiplication and matrix multiplication. Currently the ``@`` operator is not supported in this version.

Meshes
------

Warp provides a ``warp.Mesh`` class to manage triangle mesh data. To create a mesh users provide a points, indices and optionally a velocity array::

   mesh = wp.Mesh(points, indices, velocities)

.. note::
   Mesh objects maintain references to their input geometry buffers. All buffers should live on the same device.

Meshes can be passed to kernels using their ``id`` attribute which uniquely identifies the mesh by a unique ``uint64`` value. Once inside a kernel you can perform geometric queries against the mesh such as ray-casts or closest point lookups::

   @wp.kernel
   def raycast(mesh: wp.uint64,
               ray_origin: wp.array(dtype=wp.vec3),
               ray_dir: wp.array(dtype=wp.vec3),
               ray_hit: wp.array(dtype=wp.vec3)):

      tid = wp.tid()

      t = float(0.0)      # hit distance along ray
      u = float(0.0)      # hit face barycentric u
      v = float(0.0)      # hit face barycentric v
      sign = float(0.0)   # hit face sign
      n = wp.vec3()       # hit face normal
      f = int(0)          # hit face index

      color = wp.vec3()

      # ray cast against the mesh
      if wp.mesh_query_ray(mesh, ray_origin[tid], ray_dir[tid], 1.e+6, t, u, v, sign, n, f):

         # if we got a hit then set color to the face normal
         color = n*0.5 + wp.vec3(0.5, 0.5, 0.5)

      ray_hit[tid] = color


Users may update mesh vertex positions at runtime simply by modifying the points buffer. After modifying point locations users should call ``Mesh.refit()`` to rebuild the bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) structure and ensure that queries work correctly.

.. note::
   Updating Mesh topology (indices) at runtime is not currently supported, users should instead re-create a new Mesh object.

.. autoclass:: Mesh

Volumes
-------

Sparse volumes are incredibly useful for representing grid data over large domains, such as signed distance fields (SDFs) for complex objects, or velocities for large-scale fluid flow. Warp supports reading sparse volumetric grids stored using the `NanoVDB <https://developer.nvidia.com/nanovdb>`_ standard. Users can access voxels directly, or use built-in closest point or trilinear interpolation to sample grid data from world or local-space.


Volume object can be created directly from Warp arrays containing a NanoVDB grid or from the contents of a standard ``.nvdb`` file, using the ``load_from_nvdb`` method.


Below we give an example of creating a Volume object from an existing NanoVDB file::

   # open NanoVDB file on disk
   file = open("mygrid.nvdb", "rb")

   # create Volume object
   volume = wp.Volume.load_from_nvdb(file, device="cpu")

.. note::
   Files written by the NanoVDB library, commonly marked by the ``.nvdb`` extension, can contain multiple grids with various compression methods, but a ``Volume`` object represents a single NanoVDB grid therefore only files with a single grid are supported. NanoVDB's uncompressed and zip compressed file formats are supported.

To sample the volume inside a kernel we pass a reference to it by id, and use the built-in sampling modes::

   @wp.kernel
   def sample_grid(volume: wp.uint64,
                   points: wp.array(dtype=wp.vec3),
                   samples: wp.array(dtype=float)):

      tid = wp.tid()

      # load sample point in world-space
      p = points[tid]

      # transform position to the volume's local-space
      q = wp.volume_world_to_index(volume, p)

      # sample volume with trilinear interpolation
      f = wp.volume_sample_f(volume, q, wp.Volume.LINEAR)

      # write result
      samples[tid] = f



.. note:: Warp does not currently support modifying sparse-volumes at runtime. We expect to address this in a future update. Users should create volumes using standard VDB tools such as OpenVDB, Blender, Houdini, etc.

Hash Grids
----------

Many particle-based simulation methods such as the Discrete Element Method (DEM), or Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), involve iterating over spatial neighbors to compute force interactions. Hash grids are a well-established data structure to accelerate these nearest neighbor queries, and particularly well-suited to the GPU.

To support spatial neighbor queries Warp provides a ``HashGrid`` object that may be created as follows::

   grid = wp.HashGrid(dim_x=128, dim_y=128, dim_z=128, device="cuda")

   grid.build(points=p, radius=r)

Where ``p`` is an array of ``warp.vec3`` point positions, and ``r`` is the radius to use when building the grid. Neighbors can then be iterated over inside the kernel code as follows::

   @wp.kernel
   def sum(grid : wp.uint64,
         points: wp.array(dtype=wp.vec3),
         output: wp.array(dtype=wp.vec3),
         radius: float):

      tid = wp.tid()

      # query point
      p = points[tid]

      # create grid query around point
      query = wp.hash_grid_query(grid, p, radius)
      index = int(0)

      sum = wp.vec3()

      while(wp.hash_grid_query_next(query, index)):

         neighbor = points[index]

         # compute distance to neighbor point
         dist = wp.length(p-neighbor)
         if (dist <= radius):
               sum += neighbor

      output[tid] = sum

.. note:: The ``HashGrid`` query will give back all points in *cells* that fall inside the query radius. When there are hash conflicts it means that some points outside of query radius will be returned, and users should check the distance themselves inside their kernels. The reason the query doesn't do the check itself for each returned point is because it's common for kernels to compute the distance themselves, so it would redundant to check/compute the distance twice.

Differentiability
-----------------

By default Warp generates a forward and backward (adjoint) version of each kernel definition. Buffers that participate in the chain of computation should be created with ``requires_grad=True``, for example::

   a = wp.zeros(1024, dtype=wp.vec3, device="cuda", requires_grad=True)

The ``warp.Tape`` class can then be used to record kernel launches, and replay them to compute the gradient of a scalar loss function with respect to the kernel inputs::

   tape = wp.Tape()

   # forward pass
   with tape:
      wp.launch(kernel=compute1, inputs=[a, b], device="cuda")
      wp.launch(kernel=compute2, inputs=[c, d], device="cuda")
      wp.launch(kernel=loss, inputs=[d, l], device="cuda")

   # reverse pass
   tape.backward(l)

After the backward pass has completed the gradients with respect to the inputs are available via a mapping in the Tape object: ::

   # gradient of loss with respect to input a
   print(tape.gradients[a])

Note that gradients are accumulated on the participating buffers, so if you wish to re-use the same buffers for multiple backward passes you should first zero the gradients::

   tape.zero()

.. note::

   Warp uses a source-code transformation approach to auto-differentiation. In this approach the backwards pass must keep a record of intermediate values computed during the forward pass. This imposes some restrictions on what kernels can do and still be differentiable:

   * Dynamic loops should not mutate any previously declared local variable. This means the loop must be side-effect free. A simple way to ensure this is to move the loop body into a separate function. Static loops that are unrolled at compile time do not have this restriction and can perform any computation.

   * Kernels should not overwrite any previously used array values except to perform simple linear add/subtract operations (e.g.: via ``wp.atomic_add()``)

Jacobians
#########

To compute the Jacobian matrix :math:`J\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}` of a multi-valued function :math:`f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m`, we can evaluate an entire row of the Jacobian in parallel by finding the Jacobian-vector product :math:`J^\top \mathbf{e}`. The vector :math:`\mathbf{e}\in\mathbb{R}^m` selects the indices in the output buffer to differentiate with respect to.
In Warp, instead of passing a scalar loss buffer to the ``tape.backward()`` method, we pass a dictionary ``grads`` mapping from the function output array to the selection vector :math:`\mathbf{e}` having the same type::

   # compute the Jacobian for a function of single output
   jacobian = np.empty((output_dim, input_dim), dtype=np.float32)
   tape = wp.Tape()
   with tape:
      output_buffer = launch_kernels_to_be_differentiated(input_buffer)
   for output_index in range(output_dim):
      # select which row of the Jacobian we want to compute
      select_index = np.zeros(output_dim)
      select_index[output_index] = 1.0
      e = wp.array(select_index, dtype=wp.float32)
      # pass input gradients to the output buffer to apply selection
      tape.backward(grads={output_buffer: e})
      q_grad_i = tape.gradients[input_buffer]
      jacobian[output_index, :] = q_grad_i.numpy()
      tape.zero()

When we run simulations independently in parallel, the Jacobian corresponding to the entire system dynamics is a block-diagonal matrix. In this case, we can compute the Jacobian in parallel for all environments by choosing a selection vector that has the output indices active for all environment copies. For example, to get the first rows of the Jacobians of all environments, :math:`\mathbf{e}=[\begin{smallmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 & \dots & 1 & 0 & 0 & \dots\end{smallmatrix}]^\top`, to compute the second rows, :math:`\mathbf{e}=[\begin{smallmatrix}0 & 1 & 0 & \dots & 0 & 1 & 0 & \dots\end{smallmatrix}]^\top`, etc.::

   # compute the Jacobian for a function over multiple environments in parallel
   jacobians = np.empty((num_envs, output_dim, input_dim), dtype=np.float32)
   tape = wp.Tape()
   with tape:
      output_buffer = launch_kernels_to_be_differentiated(input_buffer)
   for output_index in range(output_dim):
      # select which row of the Jacobian we want to compute
      select_index = np.zeros(output_dim)
      select_index[output_index] = 1.0
      # assemble selection vector for all environments (can be precomputed)
      e = wp.array(np.tile(select_index, num_envs), dtype=wp.float32)
      tape.backward(grads={output_buffer: e})
      q_grad_i = tape.gradients[input_buffer]
      jacobians[:, output_index, :] = q_grad_i.numpy().reshape(num_envs, input_dim)
      tape.zero()


Graphs
-----------

Launching kernels from Python introduces significant additional overhead compared to C++ or native programs. To address this, Warp exposes the concept of `CUDA graphs <https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/cuda-graphs/>`_ to allow recording large batches of kernels and replaying them with very little CPU overhead.

To record a series of kernel launches use the ``warp.capture_begin()`` and ``warp.capture_end()`` API as follows: ::

   # begin capture
   wp.capture_begin()

   # record launches
   for i in range(100):
      wp.launch(kernel=compute1, inputs=[a, b], device="cuda")

   # end capture and return a graph object
   graph = wp.capture_end()


Once a graph has been constructed it can be executed: ::

   wp.capture_launch(graph)

Note that only launch calls are recorded in the graph, any Python executed outside of the kernel code will not be recorded. Typically it only makes sense to use CUDA graphs when the graph will be reused / launched multiple times.
