NVIDIA Warp Documentation
=========================

Warp is a Python framework for writing high-performance simulation and graphics code. Kernels are defined in Python syntax and JIT converted to C++/CUDA and compiled at runtime.

Warp is comes with a rich set of primitives that make it easy to write programs for physics simulation, geometry
processing, and procedural animation. In addition, Warp kernels are differentiable, and can be used as part of
machine-learning training pipelines with other frameworks such as PyTorch.

Below are some examples of simulations implemented using Warp:

Quickstart
==========

Basic example
-------------

An example first program that computes the lengths of random 3D vectors is given below::

    import warp as wp
    import numpy as np

    wp.init()

    num_points = 1024

    @wp.kernel
    def length(points: wp.array(dtype=wp.vec3),
            lengths: wp.array(dtype=float)):

        # thread index
        tid = wp.tid()
        
        # compute distance of each point from origin
        lengths[tid] = wp.length(points[tid])


    # allocate an array of 3d points
    points = wp.array(np.random.rand(num_points, 3), dtype=wp.vec3)
    lengths = wp.zeros(num_points, dtype=float)

    # launch kernel
    wp.launch(kernel=length,
            dim=len(points),
            inputs=[points, lengths])

    print(lengths)

Additional examples
-------------------
The `examples <https://github.com/NVIDIA/warp/tree/main/examples>`__ directory in
the Github repository contains a number of scripts that show how to
implement different simulation methods using the Warp API. Most examples
will generate USD files containing time-sampled animations in the
``examples/outputs`` directory. Before running examples users should
ensure that the ``usd-core`` package is installed using:

::

   pip install usd-core

USD files can be viewed or rendered inside NVIDIA
`Omniverse <https://developer.nvidia.com/omniverse>`__,
Pixar's UsdView, and Blender. Note that Preview in macOS is not
recommended as it has limited support for time-sampled animations.

Built-in unit tests can be run from the command-line as follows:

::

   python -m warp.tests

Omniverse
---------

A Warp Omniverse extension is available in the extension registry inside
Omniverse Kit or Create:

Enabling the extension will automatically install and initialize the
Warp Python module inside the Kit Python environment. Please see the
`Omniverse Warp
Documentation <http://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/extensions/warp.html>`__
for more details on how to use Warp in Omniverse.
