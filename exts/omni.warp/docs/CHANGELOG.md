## [0.2.3] - 2022-06-13

- Fix for incorrect 4d array bounds checking
- Fix for `wp.constant` changes not updating module hash
- Fix for stale CUDA kernel cache when CPU kernels launched first
- Array gradients are now allocated along with the arrays and accessible as `wp.array.grad`, users should take care to always call `wp.Tape.zero()` to clear gradients between different invocations of `wp.Tape.backward()`
- Added `wp.array.fill_()` to set all entries to a scalar value (4-byte values only currently)

### Breaking Changes

- Tape `capture` option has been removed, users can now capture tapes inside existing CUDA graphs (e.g.: inside Torch)

- Add support for calling built-in functions directly from Python interpreter outside kernels (experimental)
- Add support for auto-complete and docstring lookup for builtins in IDEs like VSCode, PyCharm, etc
- Add support for doing partial array copies, see `wp.copy()` for details
- Add support for accessing mesh data directly in kernels, see `wp.mesh_get_point()`, `wp.mesh_get_index()`, `wp.mesh_eval_face_normal()`
- Change to only compile for targets where kernel is launched (e.g.: will not compile CPU unless explicitly requested)

### Breaking Changes

- Builtin methods such as `wp.quat_identity()` now call the Warp native implementation directly and will return a `wp.quat` object instead of NumPy array
- NumPy implementations of many builtin methods have been moved to `wp.utils` and will be deprecated
- Local `@wp.func` functions should not be namespaced when called, e.g.: previously `wp.myfunc()` would work even if `myfunc()` was not a builtin
- Removed `wp.rpy2quat()`, please use `wp.quat_rpy()` instead

- `wp.mlp()` expects multi-dimensional arrays instead of one-dimensional arrays for inference, all other semantics remain the same as earlier versions of this API.
- `wp.array.length` member has been removed, please use `wp.array.shape` to access array dimensions, or use `wp.array.size` to get total element count
