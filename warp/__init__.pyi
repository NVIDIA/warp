"""The ``warp`` package provides array types and functions for creating and manipulating
multi-dimensional data on CPU and CUDA devices. It includes kernel and function decorators
(:func:`kernel`, :func:`func`) for defining parallel code, along with a comprehensive set
of built-in types and functions for use within kernels (see :doc:`/language_reference/builtins`).

The package provides device management, kernel launch and synchronization functions, automatic
differentiation via :class:`Tape` recording, type introspection and construction utilities, and
module compilation and caching.

Additional functionality is available in optional submodules that must be explicitly
imported, such as :mod:`warp.render` for visualization, :mod:`warp.fem` for finite
element methods, and :mod:`warp.sparse` for sparse linear algebra.
